# Disclaimer
This is my first Unity project. I am still learning GitHub, C#, Unity and game design in general so please feel free to give suggestions to improve my code.

# The Game's Idea
- This is a simple 2D platformer, where you complete small, challenging levels as fast as you can.
- Try to dodge all the different obstacles and enemies.
- Each level has little fruits wich you have to collect to finish the level.
- I may implement a timer to show a) how much time you're taking for the current level and b) show your record time.
- Replay levels from the level selection menu.
- Unlock new costumes for your character.
